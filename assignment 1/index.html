            <img src="img/earth-1-jpg.jpg" alt="earth" width="400px">
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered by water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, found in Earth's crust as fresh water. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive cosmic rays.</p>
